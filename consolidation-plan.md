# Code Consolidation Plan

## Objective
Consolidate duplicate implementations between src/modules and vAuto_Feature_Verification/src/modules into a single, canonical implementation.

## Analysis
- Primary implementation in src/modules is more robust with better error handling and async patterns
- Secondary implementation in vAuto_Feature_Verification has some unique features to preserve
- Need to ensure no functionality is lost during consolidation

## Implementation Steps

1. Verify Primary Implementation
- Review src/modules implementation
- Document any gaps compared to vAuto_Feature_Verification version
- Identify unique features in vAuto_Feature_Verification to preserve

2. Enhance Primary Implementation
- Port any unique features from vAuto_Feature_Verification to src/modules
- Ensure all functionality is covered
- Maintain async/await pattern and error handling

3. Remove Duplicate Implementation
- Remove vAuto_Feature_Verification directory
- Update any references to old paths
- Ensure clean removal without breaking dependencies

4. Testing
- Verify all functionality works in consolidated implementation
- Run existing tests
- Check for any broken references

## Modules to Consolidate
- feature_mapping
- checkbox_management  
- inventory_discovery
- authentication
- nova_act_engine
- window_sticker_processing

## Success Criteria
- Single implementation in src/modules
- All functionality preserved
- No duplicate code
- All tests passing
- Clean removal of vAuto_Feature_Verification
